# Fast Fourier Transform

A) Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform of a sequence. This is often done to convert a signal from its original domain (usually time or space) to the frequency domain. The concept of decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies is valuable in many fields, however performing discrete fourier transform is often too slow and therefore not practical ( $O(n^2)$ ). Fast Fourier transform provides a way to do these calculations in $O(nlog(n))$ time.
